**15. und 16. August** A residential worklab with **Varun**  
We live in times of grave conflicts. While a lot of the conflicts are socio- political,
environmental and cultural, we are affected by their presence outside our windows,
doors. We are also stirred by conflict inside, in our inner lives. How does our body, breath
and voice encounter, live with, work through and survive conflict?  
This worklab offers an intense observation and re-memberance of the struggles we
embody and breathe in response to. We shall spend time constructing practices that
recognise deep connections in the voice, between the breath and the body.
Enthusiasts, beginning and advanced practitioners, as well as teachers in any
embodied/ somatic tradition, including movements and dances are welcome.
Participants without any prior experience would also be able find solidarity in the
exercises and work attempted during the worklab.  

Accommodation in your tent or the Jurte, and food, per diem: 70€. Worklab Fee 
for the two days is a sliding scale from 100€ to 300€. Participants could choose 
any amount they feel comfortable with.
